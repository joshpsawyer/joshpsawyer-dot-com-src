Hi.

You might be here because:

- You want a Netsuite Consultant that can write SuiteScript
- You're looking for a python dev that can set up Airflow
- You want a stripped down, old-school static website, possibly generated with an SSG 
- You're programming a game in Godot and found one of my opinionated articles
- You want pixel art advice or to commission an artist for a game
- You're interested in baking the best focaccia ever or a really fantastic vegan birthday cake

Contact me at _josh \[at\] joshpsawyer \[dot\] com_ for any of the above or just to say hi.
