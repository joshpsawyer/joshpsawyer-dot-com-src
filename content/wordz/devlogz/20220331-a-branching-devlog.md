Summary: Making a game is hard!
showkofi: true

While the first game I started is [Project Sword]({filename}project-sword/20220302-sword-update-01.md), I've realized that I actually don't
have enough time to finish it before _the new kid_ arrives. I bit off more than I can chew with that one - the content isn't
that grand, but it requires a lot of custom art and with my work / life balance it's a bit too amibitous at the moment.

So that's back on the shelf, to be continued in a few months time, after the sleepless newborn nights are over and I begin feeling my soul return to my body. In the meantime, I'm working on a few very small projects which I want to wrap up quickly:

- [`A Train Ride`]({tag}a-train-ride): You're a passenger on a steam train. You can traverse the length of the train, and maybe you'll see some neat
    stuff along the way.
- [`A Drive`]({tag}a-drive): This is a test for a larger project about a family road trip, but you're in control of a Volkswagen-like van along a pleasant road.
- [`A Walk In The Cemetary`]({tag}a-walk-in-the-cemetary): Another test for a larger project, this is a game in which you muck about in a cemetary, trying to open a gate.
- [`A Campfire Conversation`]({tag}a-campfire-conversation): This is a dialogue / conversation test, it's just you and a friend having a conversation around a fire at night.
- [`A Kid's Story`]({tag}a-kids-story): This is another dialogue based game, about telling a kid a bedtime story.

The release of `A Walk In The Cemetary` and `A Campfire Conversation` will coincide with a cemetary / woods tileset on itch.io. Everything will go on itch.io. Software stack's the same - Unity, Aseprite, Ink, etc.
